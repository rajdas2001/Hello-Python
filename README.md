# Hello-Python
Recently, a lot of people were asking me about a programming language which they could learn, that wouldn't be tough for absolute beginners and would really help them build great products. So, my recommendation for them would be 'Python'. Python is a general-purpose programming language which is really fast, powerful and has tons of libraries for convenience.  The Internet is a great resource for learning the language, but finding the right material can be a tedious job. It would be like finding a needle in a haystack. So, I made this website primarily to help beginners learn the language without any hassle.  Computer Science Enthusiasts, do have a look! &lt;<br /> Website: http://hellopython.co.vu/
